## Background

Disadvantaged public high school juniors and seniors who come from first generation and low-income backgrounds have difficulty navigating the resources required to pursue higher education.

It is especially difficult for this population of students, as they often lack the information about the college application process and its specifics, such as cost, accessibility, and benefits. This population may also not know anyone from their family, or group of friends that has gone to college, so they experience more difficulty in finding resources and information related to the college application process. Itâ€™s intimidating to confront the process of discovering resources related to colleges while attempting to pursue higher education.

## Problem Statement
How might last or second-to-last year students with financial or cultural hardships, in the South Seattle area, achieve better understanding of the process to higher education and the resources available, so that they feel more prepared with resources to advance towards furthering their education?

## Solution
Through this project we seek to offer a website that will accurately display information about post-secondary paths with the steps required for its visitors to know how to accomplish their goals of post-secondary education. This project also offers a way for studets to get in contact with mentors when they need questions answered. This website also display contact information of various organizations that students can reach out to for assistance with their questions.
