    "homePageText": "Underprivileged public high school juniors and seniors who come from first generation and low-income backgrounds have difficulty navigating the resources required to pursue higher education.\n It is especially difficult for this population of students, as they often lack the information about the college application process and its specifics, such as cost, accessibility, and benefits. This population may also not know anyone from their family, or group of friends that has gone to college, so they experience more difficulty in finding resources and information related to the college application process.\n It’s intimidating to confront the process of discovering resources related to colleges while attempting to pursue higher education.\n Through this project, we seek to offer a website that will accurately display information about post-secondary paths with its steps required for the visitors of the site to gain a sense of understanding. We hope through informing people, we can give them the power to move forward in accomplishing their goals of post-secondary education. This project also offers a way for students to get in contact with mentors when they have questions related to life after high school—aiming to inspire students of potential pathways that they can go after. This website will also inform its viewers of contact information for various organizations that students can reach out to for assistance with more information. We will develop a method to better organize all of the resources available to support the students.",
